A repository that contains a bash script that can print 1 to 50 in the terminal successfully. 

Before I started, I went over more commands and best practices using several websites.
I have used for loops in the past with Python, and found a FOR loop would be best for this counter.

I used printf instead of echo because it has better format control and predictability than echo.

Lastly, I used '%d\n' to interpret and print as an integer, while adding a new line as $i cycled through.

This is how I created my counter, and I feel the code is efficient,
and gave me a basic understanding as I begin to form far more complex scripts, along with Git.
